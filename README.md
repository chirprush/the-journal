# The Math Journal

## Introduction

I am really into math. I love the exploratory feeling I when when learning
something new or perhaps tackling a problem alone. I really enjoy the feeling I
get when finding some beautiful solution or making connections between areas I
previously hadn't thought about. Mathematics truly is a beautiful world, and
this journal is sort of my letter of gratitude to that. This journal details
some (hopefully one day all) of my math progress, including problems that I
think about, beautiful patterns, and solutions whether big or small. I hope
that you enjoy and that I can instill just a little bit of my mathematical
enthusiasm into you.

In addition to math, this is also a place where I test out different
typesetting stuff with LaTeX. Not only do I want to write about math, but I
really do want to make it look beautiful and aesthetically pleasing.

## Specifics

The journal is organized into different entries, each to be thought of as more
or less a separate article, although I may reference across them sometimes. Like a
normal journal, it mostly does follow a linear fashion, but (depending on when motivation or inspiration strikes me)
I may work on previous entries after finishing current ones. The dates next to
the journal titles are really just whenever the idea comes to me really.

It's likely inevitable that some journal entries might stay incomplete for quite a while (although one can't really say that they'll ever truly be "complete").

The PDF is compiled using `latexmk` and basically whatever `vimtex` defaultly
has set, as that is by far the most convenient.
