This is hopefully going to be the start of something fun! I've been wanting a
space to document, formalize, and just have fun typesetting things and ideas
that I've been working on relating to (mostly) math. \MarginComment{This is
also very much a testing ground for my \LaTeX\ styling stuff, so keep that in
mind ;)} This journal will probably contain everything that goes into that
process: my musings, results, and work, although I'll try and keep the actual
line-for-line scratch work to a minimum, because that looks bad and isn't very
helpful. Who knows, I'll probably even throw in a couple contest math problems!

All in all, I intend to go back to previous results that I've worked on as well
as anything I come up with. This may result in a lot of sections that will be
"TODO," but I guess you can't finish all your side projects, right?

As you can probably tell, the tone is going to be quite conversational and
decently informal, but I'm not going to jump into "zoomer language" and meme
around \textit{too much}. That being said this is all for fun.

One might also ask the question, why are you writing this as if someone will
read it when in all likelihood it won't be read much? To that hypothetical
question posed by myself to myself about writing to myself, I must answer that
this is far too philosophical for me and we must move on. It's math time!
