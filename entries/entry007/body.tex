Here's a fun little probability subproblem born out of a competition math
problem that I saw recently.

\begin{blackbox}
    \begin{problem}
        Let \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) be random variables chosen uniformly
        from the interval \( \left[0, 1\right] \). What is the probability that
        \[
            x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n \ge 1
        ?\]
    \end{problem}
\end{blackbox}
